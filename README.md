# NeuralNetworks
## This repository is a collection of some of the projects and tasks I have worked on in deep learning. They have helped me to extend what I have studied in theory and to learn how these technologies are used in the real world. ##

:hammer:	The tools I have used in this project are 
- PyTorch
- PyTorch-lightning to design and train the architectures
- Tensorboard to visualize the training statistics.

:brain: Networks that I have worked with so far:
- Autoencoder
- 10 class classifier 
- Convolutional neural network for facial keypoints detection [WIP]

:bulb: Test and experiment scripts:
- Little experiment that allows to play with the behaviour of the SGD momentum.
