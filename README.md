# NeuralNetworks
This repository is a collection of some of the projects and tasks I have worked on in deep learning. They have helped me to extend what I have studied in theory and to learn how these technologies are used in the real world.

So far, the tools I have used in this project are PyTorch, PyTorch-lightning to design and train the architectures and Tensorboard to visualize the training statistics.
