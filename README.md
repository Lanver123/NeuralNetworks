# NeuralNetworks
This repository is a collection of some of the projects and tasks I have worked on in deep learning. They have helped me to extend what I have studied in theory and to learn how these technologies are used in the real world.

 The tools I have used in this project are PyTorch, PyTorch-lightning to design and train the architectures and Tensorboard to visualize the training statistics.

Networks that I have worked so far with:
- Autoencoder
- 10 class classifier 
- Convolutional neural network for facial keypoints detection [WIP]

Test and experiment scripts:
- Little experiment that allows to play with the behaviour of the SGD momentum.
